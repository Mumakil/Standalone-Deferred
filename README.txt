# Standalone Deferred

This is a standalone [jQuery type](http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/) Deferred implementation. I wanted to use the wonderful Deferred interface in projects where I don't want to include the whole big jQuery library. 

This is trying to mimic $.Deferred as much as possible, but is so far a one night project, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are differences. One major shortfall is that this one is missing all the _progress()_ related stuff and _pipe()_.
