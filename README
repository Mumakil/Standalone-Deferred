Standalone Deferred
===================

This is a standalone jQuery like (http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/) Deferred implementation. I wanted to use the wonderful Deferred interface in projects where I don't want to include the whole big jQuery library. 

This is trying to mimic $.Deferred as much as possible, but is so far a one night project, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are differences. One major shortfall is that this one is missing all the _progress()_ related stuff and _pipe()_.

Note: This implementation uses Array.prototype.forEach because it was intended to run in modern browsers.

Tests
=====

The project should have pretty complete test coverage written with Jasmine (http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) but if you see any shortcomings, feel free to notify me.
